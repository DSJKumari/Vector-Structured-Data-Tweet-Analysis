# Vector-Structured-Data-Tweet-Analysis

This is a comprehensive analysis on text data using vector embeddings performed on Twitter (now called X) dataset related to the Internet Research Agency (IRA,) popularly known as Russian Troll Factory. In the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, the agency allegedly intentionally tried to sow political discontent in the United States with inflammatory social media content. Twitter provided the dataset containing details about thousands of profiles associated with IRA. The main objective of this project is to analyse the dataset provided and show the presence of bias be it political or gender or any other. The dataset employed for the study involves a diverse range of tweet metrics, involving content, author id, date posted, updates, etc. This is used for understanding the underlying structure of the dataset and identifying interesting patterns or relationships that will further increase scope for future research.
